Tukel&#x27;s talent is considerable: DING-A-LING-LESS is so chock full of double entendres that one would have to sit down with a copy of this script and do a line-by-line examination of it to fully appreciate the, uh, breadth and width of it. Every shot is beautifully composed (a clear sign of a sure-handed director), and the performances all around are solid (there&#x27;s none of the over-the-top scenery chewing one might&#x27;ve expected from a film like this).

As an output from his Mexican era of film making, it was an invaluable talent to possess, with little money and extremely tight schedules. Nazarin, however, surpasses many of Bunuel&#x27;s previous Mexican films in terms of the acting (Francisco Rabal is excellent), narrative and theme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theme, interestingly, is something that was explored again in Viridiana, made three years later in Spain. It concerns the individual&#x27;s struggle for humanity and altruism amongst a society that rejects any notion of virtue. Father Nazarin, however, is portrayed more sympathetically than Sister Viridiana. Whereas the latter seems to choose charity because she wishes to atone for her (perceived) sins, Nazarin&#x27;s whole existence and reason for being seems to be to help others, whether [...]</td>\n",
